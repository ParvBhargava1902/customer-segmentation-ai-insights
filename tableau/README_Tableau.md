# Tableau Dashboard Notes

**Data source**: `out/churn_scores.csv` (generated by `etl_churn_model.py`).

Recommended Views:
1. **Churn KPI**: Avg `churn_prob`, segment by `plan`, `region`. Trend with time (if you add a date field).
2. **Journey Funnel**: If you add `stage` fields, show drop-offs per stage.
3. **Theme Heatmap**: Join to VoC theme counts; color by sentiment or churn uplift.
4. **Executive Summary**: Tiles for 15% churn reduction, 30% time saved, and segment insights.

> Import CSV in Tableau → build sheets above → publish to Tableau Public/Server.
